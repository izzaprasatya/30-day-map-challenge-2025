## 02 | Lines
Street network orientation for Jakarta's district. The higher the entropy value, the more organic, indicating informal settlements, old neighborhoods, or suburbs with cul-de-sac characteristics. While low entropy suggests a more planned & gridded street network.

## 04 | My Data
Coffee shops I visited during 2025. Each coffee shop has its own unique taste and signature coffee menu. Since my fondness for Toraja coffee, Bakoel Koffie and Bagi Kopi are probably my favorites, as they brew Toraja elegantly using the V60 method. Although Kopi Posko doesn’t serve Toraja, it’s also my favorite due to its affordable prices.
