## 02 | Lines
Street network orientation for Jakarta's district. The higher the entropy value, the more organic, indicating informal settlements, old neighborhoods, or suburbs with cul-de-sac characteristics. While low entropy suggests a more planned & gridded street network.

## 03 | Polygons
Subdistricts in Jakarta with a very high land-use entropy values (=> 0.7). These subdistricts exhibit highly mixed land-use structures, indicating diverse activities that coexist within compact spatial units and form multifunctional urban environments.

## 04 | My Data
Coffee shops I visited during 2025. Each coffee shop has its own unique taste and signature coffee menu. Since my fondness for Toraja coffee, Bakoel Koffie and Bagi Kopi are probably my favorites, as they brew Toraja elegantly using the V60 method. Although Kopi Posko doesn’t serve Toraja, it’s also my favorite due to its affordable prices.

## 05 | Earth
Material flows assessment from some of the mining sites in southern part of Bursa City, Türkiye using SAGA. This map shows the flow of materials from the mining sites running through the settlement areas. But of course, we can't conclude or directly observe this kind of visualization in the real field, as this map is a representation of the DEM-based flow of material.

## 06 | Dimensions
Tanaka contours of Mt. Erciyes. This technique of terrain visualization was developed by Prof. Tanaka Kitiro in 1950.

## 07 | Accessibility
School accessibility analysis for a specific point (in this case, a train station). This brief analysis aims to identify the most accessible schools from Sudimara Station using Origin-Destination (OD) lines.

## 08 | Urban
Figure-ground diagrams from 9 big cities in Indonesia. Each city represents the largest city on its respective island, reflecting its population and economy.

## 10 | Air
Wind pattern in Southeast Asia. This visualization was inspired by the excellent book Discover QGIS 3.x by Kurt Menke, which provides guidance on visualizing mesh data.
